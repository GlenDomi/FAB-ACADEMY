      <h1>1. Project management</h1>

      <p>This week I worked on defining my final project idea and started to getting used to the documentation process.
        At first was a little bit tricky but whit the help of the instructors and my classmates I did it.
        So... here it goes a resume of the things that had happened to me in that week.
           
      </p>
     
      <h2>Token Things</h2>
      <p> I have never learn/ listening to concepts like "GIT" "REPOSITORY" "PULL" "PUSH" .. So that first approach was a bit complicated to understand, for that reason I have started to made mistakes with the Token..

        At first Ive use Sourcetree, so to access to my "TOKEN" ive had to choose between: The Personal token or the Public one </p>

      </p>The interface is a friendly one and at first, I started to navigate between options, searching the option to create one token (or something like that). 
        When I found it, I've created a public token, with the parameters that the instructors had told me.

        But NO, it didnt worked me 
      </p>

      <h2>Token error message</h2>

        Output:
        Error: The host key is not cached for this server:

        PuTTY's cache and carry on connecting.

        adding the key to the cache, enter "n".

        <h2> The links that save me</h2>

        <h2>Git bash</h2>

      <p> At the end of the road I saw the light, GIT BASH and GIT GUI
          They looks tricky, but actually they are practical. you just have to put the correct parameters </p>
          
      <p> To Push your repository version, you have to know this lines...
      </p>
          <ion-list>
            ls - to see all your content
            cd - to enter to the directory
            Public/ - indicates the folder (you have to be working there to Push your file)
          </ion-list>
        </pre>
